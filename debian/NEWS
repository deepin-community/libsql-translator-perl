libsql-translator-perl (0.11011-1) unstable; urgency=low

  From upstream Changes:

  INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES:
  * SQLT no longer supports setting separate conflicting values for the now
    deprecated 'quote_table_names' and 'quote_field_names'. Instead their values
    are proxied to the new 'quote_identifiers'. If 'quote_identifiers' is
    supplied, the legacy settings are ignored (with a warning). If nothing is
    specified the default is TRUE as before. If only one is specified - default
    to its value for everything, and if both are specified with a conflicting
    value an exception is thrown.
  * Partial quoting support has been added in SQLite. It is currently disabled by
    default, you need to request is explicitly with quote_identifiers => 1. In a
    future version of SQL::Translator *THIS DEFAULT BEHAVIOR WILL CHANGE*.
    If you do NOT WANT quoting, set quote_identifiers to a false value to
    protect yourself from changes in a future release.
